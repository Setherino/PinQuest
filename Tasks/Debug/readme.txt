Hey brad.
Some info: 
.task files are the same as .txt files, so you can just open them with notepad, or whatever.
Also, don't change it from a .task file.
Also also, don't put it in any other location outside of one of the four folders.
If you do either of those things the game wont be able to find your task! 
And what a fesh hell that would be, huh?
