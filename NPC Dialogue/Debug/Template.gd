-DEFAULT DIALOGUE:
	Hi there! I'm amy!
	How are you doing?
	GOOD! I'm doing great.
	Oh, this on my shirt?
	It's nothing.
	Don't worry about it.
	DO NOT WORRY, OR ELSE.
	IF YOU WORRY, WE DIE.
-TASK DIALOGUE:
	This is where the task dialogue goes.
	The erros exist because this is a .gd file
	The editor thinks you're trying to code, lol.
	So it's kind of a pain to edit, but whatever.
-END.

You can write anything after the END tag, it doesn't read this part.
