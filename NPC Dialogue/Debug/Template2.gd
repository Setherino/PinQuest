-DEFAULT DIALOGUE:
	This is where the default dialogue goes.
	You might notice a massive ammount of errors.
	That's ok. don't even worry about it.
	Just ignore them.
-TASK DIALOGUE:
	This is where the task dialogue goes.
	The erros exist because this is a .gd file
	The editor thinks you're trying to code, lol.
	So it's kind of a pain to edit, but whatever.
-END.

You can write anything after the END tag, it doesn't read this part.
